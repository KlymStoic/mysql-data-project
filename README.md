## Project Overview

This project aims to clean and analyze the "World Layoffs CSV" dataset. The data cleaning process ensures the integrity of the dataset, while the exploratory data analysis (EDA) uncovers global trends and patterns in layoffs across various industries and regions using MySQL.

## Data Source

- **Dataset:** World Layoffs CSV
- **Description:** The dataset contains records of layoffs from companies worldwide, including details such as affected regions, industries, and timeframes.

## Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL:** Primary tool for data cleaning and analysis.

## Project Plan

### Data Cleaning

**Steps:**
1. **Remove duplicates:** Identify and eliminate duplicate records.
2. **Standardize data:** Ensure consistency in formats (e.g., date formats, text case).
3. **Check for NULL or blank values:** Identify missing or empty fields.
4. **Optimize dataset:** Remove unnecessary columns or rows that do not contribute to the analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Generate summary statistics to understand data distributions.
- Identify trends over time, such as peak periods of layoffs.
- Analyze impacts across different regions and industries.
- Use SQL queries to uncover correlations and patterns within the dataset.

## Results & Insights

- **Data Cleaning:** Successfully removed duplicates, standardized the data, and optimized the dataset.
- **EDA Findings:** Revealed global trends in layoffs, identified peak periods, and analyzed impacts across industries and regions.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate additional datasets for deeper insights.
- Develop interactive dashboards for dynamic data visualization.
- Apply advanced statistical techniques for further analysis.
